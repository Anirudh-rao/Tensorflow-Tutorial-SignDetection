# Tensorflow-Tutorial-SignDetection
This is a Basic Tutorial of hand Recognition using Tensorflow.
This is done using tensoflow version-1.

This is a basic Example of Convolutionla Nerual Networks
CNN's are one of the most prominent form of neural network.
Useful is applications like autonomous cars, Image detection , facial recognition etc.
The CNN is Built by convolving (Matrix Multiplication) of the input layer with a filter
The fliter may of reduced order or just even 1x1 matrix.
The Fliter matrix plays a key role  in CNN , and can be used to either remove borders or to just reduce the order of the matrix.
In a typical CNN, you can either have more than one filter layer.
Say you use more than one fliter layer , to pool it all together we use a pooling . Most used for of Pooling is MaxPooling, where the 
output of fliters is stacked one above the other. After the Pooling layer you can either have a Softmax layer  or more number of sets of fliter and MaxPool.
