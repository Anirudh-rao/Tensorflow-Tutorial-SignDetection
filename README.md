# Tensorflow-Tutorial-SignDetection
This is a Basic Tutorial of hand Recognition using Tensorflow.
this is done using tensoflow version-1

This is a basic Example of Convolutionla Nerual Networks
CNN's are one of the most prominent form of neural network.
Useful is applications like autonomous cars, Image detection , facial recognition etc.
The CNN is Built by convolving (Matrix Multiplication) of the input layer with a filter
The fliter may of reduced order or just even 1x1 matrix.
